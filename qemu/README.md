# QEMU Virtual Machine (VM)

We provide a QEMU VM which is equipped (1) with the MMView Linux kernel and (2) all necessary software and libraries installed required for executing our scripts/tools. All steps of the reproduction package can be executed within the VM. But please keep in mind that we ran our experiments directly on the system and that the overhang of the virtualization of the VM may result in slightly different measurements (since we paid close attention to latency-sensitive measurements).

## Host System

In case you want to prepare the host system for the execution of all scripts, i.e. reproducing the results, please see the notes below on how to compile the MMView Linux kernel and what software is required. Please use **Debian 11 (bullseye)** as host system.

We also provided a `Dockerfile` for each reproduction step (except the experiments). However, we have validated the correct functionality of our reproduction pipeline using the host system and the VM, but not with the `Dockerfiles`.

## QEMU VM

The following commands get you started using the VM:

```
# 1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/sdbs-uni-p/vldb-dbms-live-patching.git dbms-live-patching

# 2. Go into the qemu directory
cd dbms-live-patching/qemu

# 3. Download and extract QEMU VM
./download-vm

# 4. Run VM
# Note: The script assigns *all available main memory*
# and *all CPU cores except for one core per CPU socket* 
# of the host system to the VM.
./run-vm

# 5. SSH into VM (seeh credentials below)
ssh repro@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

# 6. Inside the VM:
# Download the repository and prepare the used tools
./setup
```

### Accounts (username:password):

- repro:repro
- root:root

> **_NOTE:_** In order to enable easy reproduction, security best practices were neglected. Both users are in the `sudo` group without the need for a password (`NOPASSWD` in `/etc/sudoers`).

### Switching Kernel

To reproduce our results, we require both the unmodified Linux kernel and the MMView Linux kernel. The VM includes scripts facilitating the easy switching of kernels:

```
# ssh into VM as repro user
cd ~

# Enable MMView Linux kernel
./kernel-mmview
sudo reboot

# Enable unmodified Linux kernel
./kernel-regular
sudo reboot
```

### Additional Material

- [vm-scripts/](vm-scripts): Contains scripts that are used inside the VM.

### VM Preparation Notes

The following is a brief summary about the steps performed to prepare the VM. These steps can be used as a basis for preparing a host system.

# Add NOPASSWD to sudo group
vim /etc/sudoers

# Add repro user to sudo group:
usermoad -aG sudo repro

# Enable perf (used for MariaDB patch crawling)
echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

# Increase watchdog timeout
echo 60 > /proc/sys/kernel/watchdog_thresh

# Create script "cpupower" in "/bin" as this command cannot be used inside the VM. The experimet scripts use this command heavly and should not fail because it is missing.
cd /bin
touch cpupower
chmod +x cpupower

# Install pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
# ...
# Update .bashrc and .profile of user repro based on output of pyenv installation.

# Install Python 3.10.
pyenv install 3.10.1
pyenv global 3.10.1
pip install pipenv
```

#### Linux Kernel Compilation

```
# Compile Linux Kernel (MMView)
git clone https://github.com/luhsra/linux-mmview.git
cd linux-mmview

# When compiling the kernel, disable the following options (list may not be complete):
# - CONFIG_USERFAULTFD
# - CONFIG_KSM
# - CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE
# - CONFIG_ACPI_NFIT
# - CONFIG_X86_PMEM_LEGACY
# - CONFIG_LIBNVDIMM

# ################################
# Compile kernel without modules #
# ################################
make localmodconfig
make menuconfig 
# Disable "enable loadable module support"
# Exit and save .config

# Set in .config
# - CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-mmview-min"

make -j
sudo make install

# ###################################
# Compile kernel with modules       #
# (not done but here for reference) #
# ###################################
make oldconfig

# Set in .config
# - CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-mmview"

make -j
sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
```
