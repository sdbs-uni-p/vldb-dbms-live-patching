 In order to use the wait free patching mechanism, you have to
 initialize and configure the library. This should be done at the beginning of your main function.

 wf_init will install an signal handler for SIGPATCH and spawn a thread
 that will coordinate the applying a patch when the signal was received[1].


 [1] Alternatively, there is the cyclic mode, that triggers pseudo
     migrateions every n seconds.
